I made it my mission to find a place that was both kind and efficient while also understanding of my fears and needs when it comes to a dentist. From the moment that Cristina and I spoke on the phone I knew that this was going to be the place I chose to do my dental work. From her warm demeanor to her positive attitude I felt that I could accomplish anything and had nothing to be afraid of. I first came in to get a cleaning with Dr. Ari who is equally as kind and understanding the two of them aided in talking me through everything and helping me make the best decisions for my dental health. Immediately after my cleaning I felt comfortable enough to book my first procedure. However, when arriving my nerves were extremely heightened and I no longer felt comfortable that was until Cristina talked me through the whole process and made me feel comfortable, at ease and like I had nothing to worry about. This was the first time I had ever had a dental procedure without being medicated for my anxiety and that is completely and totally due to the kindness and patience of both Cristina and Dr. Ari. I am so happy that I chose soho smile and I can’t say I am looking forward to my next dental procedure but I also won’t say that am dreading it!

A filling placed by a previous dentist was smoothed, rather than re-filled. Something about her unique attention and genuine care resonated with me deeply. I'm updating this review up one more, to the full five stars it deserves: I remember a time I wanted to provide someone in my own sphere such an experience at a time they needed it, but I was strongly discouraged to do so by a supervisor. I can only imagine if that supervisor had to be a dentist or hygienist, they wouldn't have very good reviews! Patients always know who is best, and this is a remarkable clinic.\n\nThe quality and detail in her work are beyond comparison.

The surgery was swift and painless.  Afterward, I was given a QR-coded business card with Dr. Danskin’s aftercare instructions and her direct dial.\n\nI initially went into their office after seeking a second opinion.  It was explained that my prior dentists should have never given me a root canal on a wisdom tooth. The extracted teeth should have been extracted years ago.\n\nIn addition, a week after having a perio rooting and scaling procedure in an unrelated dental office, there was still plaque on my teeth.  The staff explained that it may not be the prior dentist’s fault, but showed me unacceptable levels of plaque on the two teeth that were just removed.\n\nIt’s been less than 24 hours. There is minimal bleeding and pain (I never took the aspirin that was prescribed) thanks to the skilled hands of Dr. Danskin.\n\nI am sending the entire staff my gratitude for such a wonderful experience.

This was puzzling to me, because cavities should be covered by even the most basic dental insurance plan. I decided to cancel the appointment for this treatment. Then for my hygiene appointment soon after, they told me that (in contrast to the previous hygiene appointments at this practice) it would cost a couple of hundred dollars out of pocket, since the insurance only provided a minimal contribution.

The oral surgeon was great, quelled down my fears and got the tooth out in 5 minutes. I was given noise cancelling headphones for relaxation which really worked (and laughing gas). The office feels more like a spa, spotless and modern, and everyone working there was nice and welcoming. Sticking to it for all my dentist needs going forward."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDAD1Iwr3jYDmHzgyE2HDP0\u0026fid=0x0:0xa620e0249f67aba1""],""When"":""2025-7-9""},{""Name"":""Lindsey Gardner"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIiyR1g8XMlg7iiIxGYer6IFnPxHSGt-4SV1LQbkjY76tkRDcw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The entire staff is so kind and welcoming while the office itself is simply STUNNING - it's incredibly calming, clean and beautiful.

Just wow. When I made the appointment, I was contacted to confirm my insurance was in-network. I get yearly cleanings, so I’m familiar with the experience. The hygienist that did my cleaning was the most detailed and thorough, in my entire lifetime of dental work. She educated me on what teeth were problem areas. I also got 3 cavities filled (after my employer’s insurance, this cost around $140). The dentist was also extremely educational and nice to me. I am floored by how well run this practice is and how wonderful all parties involved were. This establishment is AMAZING and makes me excited every time I have to come back for dental work. 10/10 recommend, which seems to be the general consensus based on the reviews here."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",null,
